## How It Works
1. The slider loads with the first image active.
2. The progress bar starts animating, and after the set duration, it moves to the next slide.
3. Users can interact via buttons, thumbnails, or keyboard.
4. On mobile, swiping left/right changes slides.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Ensure you have the following files in the same directory:
   - `index.html`
   - `mystyle.css`
   - `app.js`

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. The slider will automatically start cycling through images

### Controls
- **Next/Previous Buttons**: Click the arrow buttons on either side of the main image
- **Thumbnails**: Click any thumbnail to jump directly to that slide
- **Play/Pause**: Use the play/pause buttons to control automatic transitions
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the slider to change transition speed (1-10 seconds)
- **Fullscreen**: Click the fullscreen button to view the slider in fullscreen mode
- **Keyboard**: Use left/right arrow keys to navigate
- **Mobile**: Swipe left/right to navigate

## Customization
To add your own images:
1. Replace the image URLs in both the main slides and thumbnails
2. Update the corresponding slide content (title and description)
3. Ensure thumbnail count matches main slides

## Browser Support

## Notes

- Progress bar resets with each transition
